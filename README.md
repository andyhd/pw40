# Loco Lift Rush

You are a lift operator in a busy skyscraper.

A continuous stream of passengers will arrive at random intervals on various
floors of the skyscraper, walking towards the lift to await your arrival.

It's your job to get them where they're going, but be quick about it! Each
passenger has their own patience level, and if you leave them waiting too long,
they'll storm off in a huff, adding a complaint to your record.

When you arrive at their floor, they'll board the liftâ€”but be mindful of the
4-person capacity. Once they're on, you need to transport them to their
destination floor to disembark.

Your final score is a measure of your efficiency, balancing the number of
satisfied customers against the number of complaints. As you progress, the
building grows taller, with a new floor added after every level, increasing the
challenge!
